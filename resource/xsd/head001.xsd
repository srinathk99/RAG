Description: Principles:

1A. AGENTS IDENTIFICATION -Textual Rules

-> If BICFI is present, then (Name & Postal Address) is NOT allowed (ClearingSystemMemberIdentification and LEI may complement) – However, in case of conflicting information, the BICFI will always take precedence.

-> If BICFI is absent, (Name & Postal Address) OR [(Name & Postal Address) and ClearingSystemMemberIdentification] must be present.
Exception: If BICFI is absent, whenever Debtor Agent, Creditor Agent and all agents in between are located within the same country, the clearing code only may be used.

Note: "Instructing/ Instructed Agents" must be identified with a BICFI - Clearing System Members Identification and LEI are optional.

1B. DEBTOR/CREDITOR - PARTY IDENTIFICATION - Textual Rules

-> If AnyBIC is present, then (Name and Postal Address) is NOT allowed (other elements remain optional) - However, in case of conflicting information, AnyBIC will always take precedence.

-> If Name is present, it is recommended to use Postal Address.


2. Single transactions only are allowed.


3. Character Set:

All proprietary and Text fields EXCLUDING Name and Address for all actors and Related Remittance Information and Remittance are limited to the FIN-X-Character set.

All Name and Address for all actors, Related Remittance Information and Remittance Information (structured and unstructured), Email Address where included as part of a proxy element are extended to support the following additional characters:

  !#$&%*=^_’{|}~";<>@[\]

< is replaced with &lt;
> is replaced with &gt;


4. CBPR_Agent_PointToPointOnSWIFT:

If the transaction is exchanged on the SWIFT network (ie if the instructing agent/sender and instruted agent/receiver of the message are on SWIFT), then BICFI is mandatory and other elements are optional, eg LEI

The behaviour of the Business Messages is fully described by the Business Transaction and the structure of the Business Messages is fully described by the Message Definitions and related Message Rules, Rules and Market Practices. All of which are registered in the ISO 20022 Repository.&#13;
A single new Business Message (with its accompagnying business application header) is created - by the sending MessagingEndpoint - for each business event; that is each interaction in a Business Transaction. A Business Message adheres to the following principles:&#13;
" A Business Message (and its business application header) must not contain information about the Message Transport System or the mechanics or mechanism of message sending, transportation, or receipt. &#13;
" A Business Message must be comprehensible outside of the context of the Transport Message. That is the Business Message must not require knowledge of the Transport Message to be understood.&#13;
" A Business Message may contain headers, footers, and envelopes that are meaningful for the business. When present, they are treated as any other message content, which means that they are considered part of the Message Definition of the Business Message and as such will be part of the ISO 20022 Repository.&#13;
" A Business Message refers to Business Actors by their Name. Each instance of a Business Actor has one Name. The Business Actor must not be referred to in the Transport Layer.&#13;
Specific usage of this BusinessMessageHeader may be defined by the relevant SEG.</xs:documentation>
